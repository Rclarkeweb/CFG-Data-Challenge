# CFG-Data-Challenge
The Code First Girls (CFG) Intro to Data with Python MOOC Challenge was a 4 week challenge, where I had to analyse a CSV file using Python and write my findings into a new file.

## The Challenge
The challenge was to analyse a data set ([sales_dataset.csv](https://github.com/Rclarkeweb/CFG-Data-Challenge/blob/main/sales_dataset.csv)) and complete a series of tasks.

### The Challenge Overview 
Imagine you work for a small company that sells products online. Your manager has asked you to analyse the sales data from the past year to determine which products are the best selling. You have also been asked to identify any trends in customer purchasing behaviour. 
Your task is to write a Python program that reads in a CSV file containing the sales data. 

### The Tasks:
- Use Pandas to read in the sales data from the CSV file provided in the “student materials” folder on Slack (sales_dataset.csv)
- Calculate the total sales for each product 
- Determine the average sale price for each product category 
- Identify the month with the highest sales and the month with the lowest sales
- Determine which customers made the most purchases and how much they spent in total
- Write the results of your analysis as a CSV file
- Create a slideshow presentation explaing your code

## My experience
I found the challenge difficult in places, but I'm happy with what I acheived. It was the first time I have written to a new file and analysed data with Python. I learnt a lot and would feel more comfortable now analysing other small datasets.

My python code is [here](https://github.com/Rclarkeweb/CFG-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Python%20code.py) and my findings were written to [this file](https://github.com/Rclarkeweb/CFG-Data-Challenge/blob/main/Data_analysis.csv)
